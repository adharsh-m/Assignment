Troubleshooting:
1. Tried with Restarting the redis server and got the error.
2. Found the config at /etc/redis/redis.conf and run the EXEC command manually to isolate the error.
3. Had an issue with accessing the config file so added permission to make the file accessible.
4. The next step on running failed with acess denied on log file creation at /var/log/redis-server.log.
5. Fixed up by providing permission on the Logs file.
6. Reinstalled the Redis server now to complete down any incomplete setup.
7. Started the Redis server and checked the staus and logs and everything seems to be working now.

Issue: 
Permission related issue with redis user not able to access certain config files and folders needed to start the service.
Issue might have been due to installation failures or incomplete installation.

Fix: 
Allowing redis user the Permission needed and reinstalling the redis-server fixed the issue and the service is now up and running.
